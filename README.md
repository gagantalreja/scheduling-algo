## Problem Statement
######Design an interactive platform (Web, app) for CPU scheduling algorithms (minimum requirement: outcome to be displayed in a Gantt chart)

### Overview
* **Solution Overview**
  1. We created the logic and implemented the code of 
     6 priority scheduling algorithms , namely
	- FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS)
	- SHORTEST JOB FIRST (SJF)
	- SHORTEST REMAINING TIME FIRST (SRTF)
	- ROUND ROBIN (RR)
	- PRIORITY SCHEDULING
  2. On taking the user inputs of number of processes , arrival time and burst time of processes and priority in the case of PRIORITY SCHEDULING and time quantum in the case of ROUND ROBIN , the program will return the GANTT CHART based on the respective inputs.

* **Technologies Used**
  * **PyQt5** for User Interface
  * **Matplotlib** for plotting gantt charts

* **Known Bugs**
  *  The software does not consider I/O operation timing.

* **Installation Guide**
 * No Installation required. The **hackathon.exe** file can directly be executed.
 
### Future Improvements
* More scheduling algorithms can be added in future.

### Challenges Faced
1. We realized how different and difficult it is to think of the logic of the various scheduling algorithms used and how different it is from doing these problems on paper as compared to implementing it in code.
2. We had to handle all the exceptions and think of all the mistakes the user can make while running our program .


### Learnings
1. Implementation of scheduling algorithms in code 
2. Basics of software development.
3. Use of Markdown.
4. Git
